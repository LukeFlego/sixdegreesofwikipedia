# sixdegreesofwikipedia
Loads a random featured Wikipedia page, and loads a page from that, then loads a page from that, then... you get the idea.

## What does it do?
Six Degrees of Wikipedia simply:

1. Picks a random link from the contents of Wikipedia’s Featured Article page
2. Loads a summary from that link
3. Picks a random link from that summary
4. Repeat Step 2 until 6 “degrees” have been found (Now configurable in the settings)

## How do I use it?
I personally use it as my new tab page. Closing my browser when my feeds are stale, then re-opening it is a hard habit to break…
